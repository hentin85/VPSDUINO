#### Official getting started guides for creating an account and setting up miners on variety of devices are available <a href="https://revoxhere.github.io/duino-coin/getting-started">on the official website</a>.

<h3 align="center">Installing Duino-Coin</h2><br>

The easiest way to get started with Duino-Coin is to download [the latest release](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/releases/latest) for your OS.<br>
After downloading, unzip it and launch the desired program.<br>
There are no dependencies required.

<hr>

If you want to run the programs from source, you may need to install some dependencies. Here's how to do it on debian-based distros(e.g. Ubuntu, Debian, raspian):
```BASH
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip git
git clone https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin
cd duino-coin
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you are on Windows, download [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), then [our repository](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/archive/master.zip), extract it and open the folder in command prompt. In CMD, type:
```BASH
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note for Windows users: Make sure python and pip are added to your PATH

After doing this, you are good to go with launching the software (e.g. `python3 PC_Miner.py` OR `py PC_Miner.py`).

<hr>

You can also get the whole Duino-Coin bundle on the AUR - just install it with your favourite AUR Helper:

```BASH
sudo pacman -S yay
yay -S duino-coin
```

Duino-Coin AUR bundle is maintained by [PhereloHD](https://github.com/PhereloHD).

<h3 align="center">wDUCO tutorial</h3><br>

wDUCO is DUCO wrapped on the Tron network. Currently there aren't many uses for it, other than just storing funds in external wallet or exchanging wDUCO to another token on JustSwap. Before doing anything, make sure you have `tronpy` (tron lib) and `cryptography` (for encrypting private key) modules for python3 installed.

### Configuring wDUCO Wrapper

1. Open your DUCO GUI (desktop) or CLI (console) Wallet
2. If you're using the GUI Wallet:
    1. Open the settings tab
    2. Click the **Configure Wrapper** button
3. If you're using the CLI Wallet:
    1. Start wrapper configuration tool by typing `wrapperconf`
4. Input your private key (for example your tronlink key) and set a passphrase used for encrypting it

### Configuring wDUCO Wrapper in the CLI Wallet

### Wrapping DUCO

After setting up the wrapper in one of the two wallets, you can wrap DUCOs (convert them to wDUCO).

1. Open your Wallet
2. Type `wrap` to start the wrapping process OR click **Wrap DUCO** button
3. Follow the instructions displayed by the wallet

### Unwrapping DUCO

After setting up the wrapper in one of the two wallets, you can unwrap wDUCOs (convert them to DUCO).
**Note: make sure you have some TRX in your wallet for the fees!** Unwraping will use ~5 TRX (~0.5 USD) as fees.

1. Open your Wallet
2. Type `unwrap` to start the unwrapping process OR click **Unwrap DUCO** button
3. Follow the instructions displayed by the wallet

<h2 align="center">License</h2><br>

Duino-Coin is mostly distributed under the MIT License. See `LICENSE` file for more information.
Some third-party included files may have different licenses - please check their `LICENSE` statements (usually at the top of the source code files).

<h2 align="center">Terms of service</h2><br>
1. Duino-Coins ("DUCOs") are earned by miners with a process called mining.<br/>
2. Mining is described as using DUCO-S1 algorithm (explained in the <a href="https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/blob/gh-pages/assets/whitepaper.pdf">Duino-Coin Whitepaper</a>), in which finding a correct result to a mathematical problem gives the miner a reward.<br/>
3. Mining can be officially done using CPUs, AVR boards (e.g. Arduino boards), Single-board computers (e.g. Raspberry Pi boards), ESP32/8266 boards with the usage of official miners (other officially allowed miners are described in the upper part of README).<br/>
4. Mining on GPUs, FPGAs and other high-efficiency hardware is allowed, but using only the `EXTREME` mining difficulty.<br/>
5. Any users using miners on difficulty not suited for their hardware (see the <a href="https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/tree/useful-tools#socket-api">difficulty list</a>) will be automatically throttled and/or blocked.<br/>
6. Any users spotted using inappropriate and/or overpowered hardware will be banned manually or automatically from the network without prior notice.<br/>
7. Banning involves blocking the user from accessing his coins along with the removal of an account.<br/>
8. Only coins earned legally are eligible for the exchange.<br/>
9. Users spotted using a VPN (or similar) with malicious intents (e.g. bypassing limits) may be banned without prior notice.<br/>
10. Multiple accounts used to bypass limits may be banned without prior notice.<br/>
11. Accounts may be suspended temporarily to investigate ("investigations") ToS violations ("violation" or "abuse").<br/>
12. Multiple accounts used to evade bans will be banned without prior notice.<br/>
13. An exchange request made to the offical DUCO-Exchange ("the offical exchange") may be delayed and/or declined during investigations. <br/>
14. Exchange requests made to the offical exchange may be declined due to ToS violations and/or low funding.<br/>
15. A user's DUCOs may be burnt if a violation can be proven.<br/>
16. These terms of service can change at any time without prior notice.<br/>
17. Every user using Duino-Coin agrees to comply with the above rules.<br/>
<h4 align="center">Privacy policy</h2><br>
1. On the master server we only store usernames, hashed passwords (with the help of bcrypt) and e-mails of users as their account data.<br/>
2. E-mails are not publicly available and are only used for contacting user when needed, confirming exchanges on the <a href="https://revoxhere.github.io/duco-exchange/">DUCO-Exchange</a> and receiving an occasional newsletter (planned for the future).<br/>
3. Balances, transactions and mining-related data is publicly available in the public <a href="https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/tree/useful-tools#http-json-api">JSON APIs</a>.<br/>
4. The privacy policy may be changed in the future with a prior notification.
